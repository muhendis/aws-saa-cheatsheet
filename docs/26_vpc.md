| **VPC Basics**             | - A **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** is a logically isolated network.<br>- Define IPv4 and optional IPv6 CIDRs.<br>- Subnets are tied to **Availability Zones (AZs)**.<br>- Public subnets connect via **Internet Gateway (IGW)**. | - 5 IP addresses per subnet are reserved by AWS.<br>- Ensure non-overlapping CIDRs for corporate or peered VPCs.<br>- Limit of 5 VPC CIDRs per region by default (soft limit). |
| **CIDR & IP Allocation**   | - **CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** determines IP ranges.<br>- Examples:<br> - `/16` = 65,536 IPs.<br> - `/24` = 256 IPs.<br> - `/28` = 16 IPs (minimum size for AWS).                                                    | - Public IP ranges: Internet routable.<br>- Private IP ranges: <br> - `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`.<br>- AWS accounts get a default VPC.                    |
| **Routing**                | - Use **Route Tables** for directing subnet traffic:<br> - Public subnet: Route to IGW.<br> - Private subnet: Route to **NAT Gateway**.<br>- VPC Peering requires custom routes.                                                  | - Route propagation can simplify **Direct Connect (DX)** or **Site-to-Site VPN** routing setups.                                                                               |
| **Security**               | - **Security Groups (SG):**<br> - Instance-level, stateful rules.<br> - Only allow rules supported.<br>- **NACL (Network ACLs):**<br> - Subnet-level, stateless rules.<br> - Support allow/deny.                                  | - Use ephemeral ports for dynamic connections:<br> - Linux: `32768–60999`.<br> - Windows: `49152–65535`.<br>- AWS reserves a default NACL per subnet.                          |
| **NAT Gateway & Instance** | - **NAT Gateway:** Managed by AWS for high availability; supports IPv4.<br>- **NAT Instance:** Custom EC2-based NAT setup, supports advanced configurations.                                                                      | - NAT Gateway is the recommended solution for production.<br>- NAT Instances require manual scaling and are less reliable.                                                     |
| **Bastion Host**           | - Public EC2 instance for SSH access to private instances.<br>- Deployed in a public subnet.<br>- Connect securely using Security Group rules.                                                                                    | - Limit inbound traffic to port `22` from specific corporate IPs for SSH.                                                                                                      |
| **VPC Peering**            | - Connects two VPCs (same/different accounts or regions).<br>- CIDRs must not overlap.<br>- Peering is **not transitive** (requires separate connections for each VPC pair).                                                      | - Update **Security Groups** and **Route Tables** for traffic to flow between VPCs.                                                                                            |
| **VPC Endpoints**          | - **Gateway Endpoint:** For S3/DynamoDB (no cost).<br>- **Interface Endpoint (PrivateLink):** For other AWS services (charges apply).                                                                                             | - Preferred for private connections to AWS services.<br>- Avoid public internet to save costs and enhance security.                                                            |
| **Traffic Monitoring**     | - **VPC Flow Logs**: Monitor traffic on VPC, Subnet, or ENI levels.<br>- Capture logs for accepted/rejected traffic.                                                                                                              | - Logs can be sent to CloudWatch, S3, or Kinesis for analysis.<br>- Helps troubleshoot connectivity issues and detect malicious activity.                                      |
| **Transit Gateway**        | - Centralized hub for connecting multiple VPCs, VPNs, and DX connections.<br>- Supports thousands of connections.<br>- Works across accounts and regions.                                                                         | - Use **Route Tables** to manage traffic flow between connected networks.<br>- Supports multicast and IP routing.                                                              |
| **Direct Connect (DX)**    | - Private, dedicated connection between on-premises and AWS.<br>- Lower latency and higher bandwidth compared to VPN.<br>- Supports hybrid cloud setups.                                                                          | - Requires a Virtual Private Gateway for VPC access.<br>- Use Direct Connect Gateway for multi-region or multi-VPC setups.                                                     |
| **IPv6 Support**           | - IPv6 is public and Internet-routable.<br>- Use **Egress-Only IGW** for outbound IPv6 traffic from private subnets.                                                                                                              | - IPv4 cannot be disabled; VPCs operate in dual-stack mode (IPv4 + IPv6).                                                                                                      |
| **Advanced Security**      | - **AWS Network Firewall:** Protects VPCs with Layer 3–7 filtering.<br>- **WAF/Shield:** Protects against DDoS or malicious web requests.                                                                                         | - Centralized management with **AWS Firewall Manager**.                                                                                                                        |
| **Cost Optimization**      | - Use private IPs within the same AZ.<br>- Gateway Endpoints are free for S3/DynamoDB.<br>- Minimize cross-region traffic to reduce egress costs.                                                                                 | - Consider **S3 Transfer Acceleration** for faster uploads but at additional cost.                                                                                             |
| **Miscellaneous**          | - **Egress-Only IGW:** IPv6-only NAT functionality.<br>- **Traffic Mirroring:** Debug and monitor network traffic.<br>- **ClassicLink:** Connect EC2-Classic instances to VPC.                                                    | - ClassicLink is outdated and discouraged for new setups.                                                                                                                      |
